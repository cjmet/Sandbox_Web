    /* this is what makes it fill the viewport */
    /* this was ommitted from the discussion and demos */
    html,
    body {
    height: 100%;
    margin: 0;
    }
    ```
    ```
    /* align-content, justify-content, flex-grow; all interact. */
    /* content automatically grows perpendicular, toggle grow for parralel */
    /* toggle grow if you want to modify the justify/align parralel */
    /* align-content: space-around; */
    /* justify-content: space-around; */
    ```
